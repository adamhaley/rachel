After training full time at London's prestigious Laine Theatre Arts, Rachel returned to her native Australia where she performed with the Australian Ballet (corps de ballet) and the Opera Australia Ballet Company.

While dancing professionally with these companies in Melbourne Rachel began training in Aerial Silks, Lyra and Trapeze at the National Institute of Circus Arts. In 2004 Rachel developed her own solo act on Silks and was offered a contract to perform as an Aerialist at Tokyo Disneyland in Japan. During her spare time in Japan Rachel studied and performed with re-noun Japanese Aerialist Kumi Wakaido.

In 2006 Rachel re-located to Los Angeles where she currently resides. She performs regularly as a freelance Aerialist for Cirque du Soleil (private events), celebrity parties (Playboy Mansion, Elizabeth Taylor, the Jackson's). She has also appeared as a dancer/aerialist and worked as a choreographer for numerous commercials, music videos and films. Clients include Vidal Sasoon, Jessica Biel (Powder Blue), Mams Taylor (featuring Snoop Dogg) Tango Nuevo Cabaret, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet, Cabiri Physical Theater and Myo Dance Company.

In January 2010 Rachel formed her own Aerial Dance Company ObjectDefy Entertainment with business partner Janie Van Halen. The company defies traditional dance genres by incorporating Aerial Silks, Lyra, Hammock, invented apparatus, stilting and capoeira into its full length shows. The company is currently in rehearsals preparing for a summer tour.
